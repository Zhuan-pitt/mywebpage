Zhuan is a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at the University of Pittsburgh, mentored by Prof. Roger Mong. He specializes in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning, applying advanced statistical methods and computational techniques to complex theoretical and practical challenges.

Currently as a summer graduate intern at Los Alamos National Lab under the supervision of Dr. Andrey Lokhov, Zhuan focuses on enhancing modeling systems and optimizing large-scale sampling operations. At the University of Pittsburgh, he focuses on condensed matter theory, especially the topological phase of matter and its potential application to quantum computing. Utilizing various computational libraries, Zhuan performs in-depth simulations and data analyses to tackle intricate problems across diverse fields, including quantum error correction, quantum information, and superconducting devices.

Before joining UPitt, Zhuan studied physics at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China (BSc). During his undergraduate study, he worked on low-rank approximation algorithms based on the tensor network under the supervisor of Prof. Pan Zhang, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

With a robust background in theoretical physics and applied statistics, Zhuan is well-prepared to contribute to data science and machine learning projects, aiming to drive technological and industrial advancements through innovative approaches.
