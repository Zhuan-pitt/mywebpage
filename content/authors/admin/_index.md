Zhuan is a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the University of Pittsburgh under the supervision of Prof. Roger Mong. He is broadly interested in condensed matter theory, especially the topological phase of matter and its potential application to quantum computing. His current Ph.D. project aims to understand the critical properties of standard and higher-order percolation on networks and hypergraphs respectively, and how network topologies and geometries affect the robustness and other critical behaviors. 

Before joining UPitt, Zhuan studied physics at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China (BSc). During his undergraduate study, he worked on low-rank approximation algorithms based on tensor network under the supervisor of Prof. Pan Zhang, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
